Use ODE simulation for jit compiling 

Can I launch jobs on separate threads? 


Setup
  Choose 3 var, their default values and stdev for noise 
  Choose 3 outputs, their 'mode' (duration, amplitude, decay rate)
  If fitting, provide truth values for these modes
  Number of draws
  If fitting, number of progeny 

Initialization
  Randomly draw numbers (store in object) for variable

Run 
  Run and record mode values into object

Post
  Collect objects and write data to file 


If fitting, 
  take top N that minimize error 
  define the parameter values as the new default
  repeat init-run-post sequence until happy
